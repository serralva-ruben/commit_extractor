# Trial of making a commit extractor for vulnerability lookup during the Open Source Security Software Hackathon in Luxembourg (hackathon.lu)

# unfortunately it is not working for its intended purpose

# two strategies were adopted, searching in the web pages using regex, and by running an llm

# both contain a lot of false positives, with the llm being very slow and inaccurate
# Regex seems to be better but its still a challenge to pinpoint exactly where the commit code is in the page html
